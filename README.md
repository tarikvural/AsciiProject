# ASCII Art generator

Small React Project that converts an image into ASCII art

You can play around with different font sizes and watch the fidelity of the image go up or down :)

It might be interesting to allow for any characters to be used. You would need to calculate how much any character occupies within the given cell size.
If you expand on this please let me know.
